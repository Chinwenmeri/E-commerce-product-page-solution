## Overview

This is an amazing project to do to improve some core frontend design skills like mastering flexboxes and spacing and adding functionality with JavaScript.

### The challenge

In building this project, I was able

- create the hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- create a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- implement the function to switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I better practised flex boxes and handled adding functionality to elements in Javascript.
I worked for the first time with the dialog tag and this was interesting as I would be working with it more to better understand it and perfect the usage.

### Continued development

In this project and in subsequent projects, I intend to better understand the Javascript aspects of the projects I intend to work on.
Also to understand the logic behind how the cart works as I wasn't able to implement that function on this project. I also want to better understand how responsiveness works so to add them with more intentionality to the project I would be building in the future.
